        <div id="num0"> Click "Next" to start.</div>
        <div id="num1"> Hey babe.</div>
        <div id="num2"> I've been wanting to do something for you lately..</div>
        <div id="num3"> So I decided to make you this nifty little website.</div>
        <div id="num4"> You see, you mean so much to me. I would do anything
                        to make you happy. </div>
        <div id="num5"> But after a while, I feel like sending you sweet messages
                        telling you how much I love you started to get boring.</div>
        <div id="num6"> So I made you a website! </div>
        <div id="num7"> Babe, you mean the world to me. I would do anything for you.
                        I know with all your stress lately we haven't really been
                        been able to do much of anything besides study, but that's okay.
                        Just being with you makes me feel happy and content. </div>
        <div id="num8"> And as far as your presentation goes, you're gonna do
                        amazing! Because you're Allie Simms, the smartest, hardest
                        working, most driven person I know! Not to mention, you're
                        the cutest, sweetest, funniest, sexiest woman ever. Although
                        I'm not sure that is gonna help you with your presentation.
                        The only down side I've seen in you is that you're brutally
                        competitive and will never let your boyfriend win in anything..</div>
        <div id="num9"> You seriously have made me so happy over the past 18 months.
                        (by the way, we both forgot about our 18th monthaversary)
                        I know this is just some stupid website, but you mean so much
                        to me, this is my way of letting you know you are my world,
                        also while trying to cheer you up.</div>
        <div id="num10"> I'm getting off subject though. Anyways, the point I've been trying
                        to make is.. </div>
        <div id="num11">I LOVE YOU! </div>
        <div id="num12">...why are you still clicking the button? Wouldn't you think
                        "I love you" is such a nice way to end it? Geez. </div>
        <div id="num13">Well if you're gonna keep clicking, I guess I better make it good..
                        <br><img src="1.jpg" width="20%" border="5px"/></div>
        <div id="num14"><img src="2.jpg" width="20%" border="5px"/></div>

                        <br><img src="3.jpg" width="20%" border="5px"/></div>
        <div id="num16">I'm going to sleep. Goodnight!
